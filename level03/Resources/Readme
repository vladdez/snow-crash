# system = exec - executes a command
# export -  make the local shell variable VAR global or called by PATH.
# $PATH - environmental variable, a colon-delimited list of directories that tells the shell which directories to search for executable files.
# PATH=/tmp - only tmp directory would be in PATH
# PATH=/tmp:$PATH - tmp directory will be added to the existing list in PATH

# level03 calls echo -> save variable called echo with text getflag -> add directory with it to the PATH
