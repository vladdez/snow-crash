# CGI script - any program (in our case perl) which provide this interaction

# netstat - shows all ports what are listened 
# - t - TCP connections
# - l - ports actively listened

# find port (listeend and inside the script) -> put getflag instead x into server
# \ - for ecraning
# ´´ - the backtick allows you to assign the output of a shell command to a variable
