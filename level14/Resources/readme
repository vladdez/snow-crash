# ptrace (process trace) - allows tracing of any program executions. Used in debuggers. 
# But only one tracing in a time is possible. 
# So if a program trace itself alredy, you can not trace and debug it. Second tracing attempt will give -1


# PLT - Procedure Linkage Table which is, put simply, used to call external procedures/functions whose address isn't known in the time of linking
